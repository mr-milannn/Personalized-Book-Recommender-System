📚 Personalized Book Recommendation System

A feature-rich recommendation engine built using the Goodbooks-10K dataset, combining Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and a Hybrid Model to deliver personalized book recommendations. The project includes a Streamlit app for an interactive user experience and a comparative evaluation of different approaches.

🚀 Features

🔍 Search & Discover – Search books by title/author and get tailored recommendations.

🤝 Collaborative Filtering – Recommends books based on user–item interactions (SVD/NMF).

📑 Content-Based Filtering – Uses TF-IDF & cosine similarity on book metadata.

🔗 Hybrid Model – Combines collaborative & content-based for improved accuracy.

📊 Evaluation Metrics – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score with visualizations.

🎨 Streamlit App – Intuitive UI with charts, interactive search, and recommendation results.
